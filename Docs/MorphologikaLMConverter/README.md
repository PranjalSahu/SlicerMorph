## MorphologikaLMConverter
**SUMMARY:** This module convertes [Morphologika 2.5](https://sites.google.com/site/hymsfme/downloadmorphologica) formatted data files into series of fcsv files that can be  loaded into Slicer or directly input into the SlicerMorph's GPA module.

### USAGE

User needs to locate a morphologika data file on disk, and specify an output folder where each specimen's landmarks will be saved individually. **Important Note:**  we use the optional data structure [names] to generate the filenames of individual fcsv files, so your morphologika file should have the necessary [names] data structure.

Please let us know if you encounter issues using this module. Sharing your data file will greatly expedite the resolution, as we have only a couple morphologika data files to test the module.
